== Non-Semantic HTML

=== Problem:
Using `<div>` elements for navigation links and clickable items instead of semantically appropriate `<nav>`, `<a>`, and `<button>` elements. This practice makes content less understandable to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

=== Solution:
Replace non-semantic `<div>` elements with semantic HTML:
[source,html]
----
<nav>
  <a href="#home">Home</a>
  <a href="#about">About</a>
  <a href="#events">Events</a>
  <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
</nav>
<button onclick="showMoreInfo();">More Info</button>
----

=== Impact:
Semantic HTML improves the document's structure, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret and for users to navigate the content.

== Improper Use of `tabindex`

=== Problem:
Arbitrary use of positive `tabindex` values disrupts the natural tab order, leading to a confusing and inaccessible navigation experience for keyboard users.

=== Solution:
Only use `tabindex="0"` to include elements in the natural keyboard tab order and `tabindex="-1"` for elements that need to be programmatically focused. Avoid positive `tabindex` values.

=== Impact:
Ensures a logical tab order that aligns with the visual layout, enhancing keyboard navigation for users with disabilities.

== Poor Color Contrast

=== Problem:
Text and background colors with insufficient contrast make content difficult to read, especially for users with low vision or color blindness.

=== Solution:
Use high-contrast color combinations that meet or exceed WCAG AA standards, ensuring text is easily distinguishable from the background.

=== Impact:
Improves readability for all users, including those with visual impairments, by making content more perceivable.

== Missing Alternative Text for Images

=== Problem:
Images without `alt` text are inaccessible to screen reader users, who miss out on the information conveyed by the images.

=== Solution:
Add descriptive `alt` text to all images:
[source,html]
----
<img src="event-placeholder.jpg" alt="A collage representing various tech events">
----

=== Impact:
Ensures that all users, including those using screen readers, can understand the content conveyed by images.

== Inaccessible Navigation and Dynamic Content

=== Problem:
Clickable elements created with `<div>` and `<a href="#" onclick="...">` are not accessible by keyboard alone, and dynamic content changes are not announced to screen reader users.

=== Solution:
Use `<button>` for clickable actions and ARIA roles or properties to inform screen reader users of dynamic content changes. Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and accessible via keyboard.

=== Impact:
Improves the operability of web content for keyboard and screen reader users, making interactive elements usable and dynamic content changes perceivable.
